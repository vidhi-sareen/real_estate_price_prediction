# Real_Estate_Price_Prediction
âœ¨Using the banglore housing pricing dataset from kaggle.com, we will first create a model using sklearn and linear regression.<br>
<br>
âœ¨The next step is to create a flask server in Python that uses the stored model to serve http requests.<br>
<br>
âœ¨The third component is a website developed in html, CSS, and javascript that allows users to input information such as square footage, bedrooms, and so on, and then calls a Python Flask server to receive the estimated price.<br>
<br>
âœ¨Almost all data science principles will be covered during model creation, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, and so on. This project covers the following technologies and tools in terms of technology and tools:<br>
<br>
ðŸ‘‰1)Python, for starters.<br>
ðŸ‘‰2) Data cleansing with Numpy and Pandas<br>
ðŸ‘‰3) Data visualisation with Matplotlib<br>
ðŸ‘‰4) Sklearn for model construction<br>
ðŸ‘‰5) As an IDE, Jupyter notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm<br>
ðŸ‘‰6) For the http server, use Python flask.<br>
ðŸ‘‰7) User interface (HTML/CSS/Javascript)<br>
